• What are the new tags added in HTML5?
ANS-->There has been a few elements introduced in HTML5. Some of them were imported from XHTML2, others from large statistical surveys on made by Google, Opera and other people. The analysis of class names and id names helped defining what were the most common semantic patterns. These new elements are not yet completely imported in all browsers at this time.

• How to embed audio and video in a webpage?
ANS-->src This attribute stands for the source, which is very similar to the src attribute used in the image element. We will add the link to a video file in the src attribute.
type This is going to be video/mp4 because . mp4 is the format of the video we are using.
• Semantic element in HTML5?
ANS-->A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.

Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.

Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content.
Many web sites contain HTML code like: <div id="nav"> <div class="header"> <div id="footer"> to indicate navigation, header, and footer.

In HTML there are some semantic elements that can be used to define different parts of a web page:  

<article>
<aside>
<details>
<figcaption>
<figure>
<footer>
<header>
<main>
<mark>
<nav>
<section>
<summary>
<time>
• Canvas and SVG tags 
ANS-->SVG: The Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an XML-based image format that is used to define two-dimensional vector-based graphics for the web. Unlike raster image (Ex .jpg, .gif, .png, etc.), a vector image can be scaled up or down to any extent without losing the image quality.
An SVG image is drawn out using a series of statements that follow the XML schema — that means SVG images can be created and edited with any text editor, such as Notepad. There are several other advantages of using SVG over other image formats like JPEG, GIF, PNG, etc.

Canvas: The HTML element is used to draw graphics on the fly, via scripting (usually JavaScript). The element is only a container for graphics. You must use a script to actually draw the graphics. Canvas has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and adding images.
